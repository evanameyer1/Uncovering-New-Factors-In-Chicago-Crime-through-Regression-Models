# Chicago Crime Forecasting: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models

**Authors**: Adam Younes, Evan Meyer

## Project Proposal and Action Plan

### Overview

The Machine Learning Crime Prediction project aims to predict violent and non-violent crimes in Chicago using a multivariate multi-step time-series model. Leveraging machine learning techniques and tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, and SKLearn, this project seeks to provide insights into crime patterns and trends. The deliverables include a Medium article and an academic paper detailing the methodology, findings, and comparative analysis.

### Goals

- Deepen understanding of machine learning and time-series analysis.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for crime prediction.
- Utilize industry-standard technologies.
- Document the process and findings comprehensively.

### Revised Hypothesis

A custom-built multivariate multi-step time-series model, incorporating various infrastructure and socio-economic datasets, will outperform traditional models (ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, Random Forest) in predicting both violent and non-violent crimes in Chicago.
